# BounD
Graphic Novel Engine

This collection of files will be implemented using HTML, CSS and javascript. The intent is to provide artists and storytellers to prototype interactive graphic novels.  Then a migration path will be provided to port the database of images, sounds, puzzles, objects, and prose into a Unity3D application.
